In this project, I conducted a comprehensive revenue analysis for a hospitality company, focusing on identifying key factors driving revenue growth and uncovering opportunities for optimization. Leveraging tools such as SQL and Power BI, I analyzed large datasets to derive actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

Objectives:
Analyze revenue performance across different segments (e.g., room types, booking channels, customer demographics).
Identify trends and patterns influencing revenue growth.
Provide recommendations to optimize pricing strategies and enhance revenue management.

Tools Used:
MS EXCEL: For extracting and querying data from the company's datas.
Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to present the findings.

Key Insights:
1.Segment Performance: Analyzed revenue by room types, booking channels, and customer segments to identify top performers and underperforming areas.
2.Occupancy and Pricing Trends: Examined occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR) to uncover seasonal trends and pricing patterns.
3.Booking Channels Analysis: Evaluated the performance of different booking channels (direct bookings, OTAs, corporate bookings) to determine their impact on overall revenue.
4.Customer Insights: Analyzed customer demographics and preferences to identify high-value customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

Recommendations:
Dynamic Pricing Strategy: Implement dynamic pricing based on demand patterns, seasonality, and competitive analysis to maximize revenue.
Channel Optimization: Focus on promoting high-performing booking channels and negotiating better terms with OTAs to improve profitability.
Customer Segmentation: Develop targeted marketing campaigns for high-value customer segments to drive repeat business and increase customer loyalty.
Revenue Management: Enhance revenue management practices by leveraging data analytics to make informed pricing and inventory decisions.

This project demonstrated the importance of data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry and showcased my ability to utilize Power BI for comprehensive revenue analysis and visualization.
